
1) define a functional interface "First" with an abstract method "void disp1()" , default method "void disp2()" and a static method "void disp3()"

inside main function using lambda expression invoke "disp1()" and "disp2()" methods.
also invoke "disp3()" method inside main.

2) define a functional interface "Second" with an abstract method "void disp4()".

define a class Demo with main function.
inside main function create two implementations of "Second" using lambda expression and display their names.

3) define a functional interface "MyInterface" with an abstract method "void fun()"

define a class Demo with two functions "static void perform" and main.

from main function pass lambda expression, collect it in "perform" method and invoke "fun()" function.

4) define a functional interface "Calculator" with an abstract method "int multiply(int a,int b)"
define a class "CalcDemo" with main method.
inside main using lambda create an implementation of "Calculator" , invoke "multiply()" method and display its result.

5) define a class "Display" with "void disp" method. inside this method display values from 1 to 10.

create an implementation of "Runnable" using lambda expression which will invoke "disp()" method of "Display" class.

create 2 threads and pass above created "Runnable" implementation to these threads.
make sure while one thread is executing other thread will not interfere.
