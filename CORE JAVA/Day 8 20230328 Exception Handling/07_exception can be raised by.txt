An exception in Java can be raised by:
1) The JVM (automatically)
2) The Application / Developer (manually)

When an exception is raised, it happens in two steps:

1) Instantiation
   - An object of a specific exception class is created.
   - Example: new NullPointerException(), new SQLException()
   - At this stage, no control flow change occurs.

2) Throwing
   - The exception object is thrown to the caller.
   - Normal program execution stops immediately.
   - The JVM searches for a matching catch block.
   - If not found, the exception propagates up the call stack.
   - If unhandled, the program terminates.

Both JVM-raised and developer-raised exceptions follow the same mechanism:
create the exception object → throw it → handle or propagate.



// Complete Exception Flow in Java (from detection to handling):

1) An exceptional condition is detected
   - Either by the JVM (e.g., divide by zero, null access)
   - Or by the developer using the `throw` statement

2) Instantiation of the exception
   - An object of the appropriate exception class is created
   - Stack trace information is captured at this moment

3) Throwing the exception
   - The exception object is thrown from the method where it occurred
   - Normal execution of that method stops immediately

4) JVM searches for a handler in the same method
   - If a matching `catch` block exists:
       → the exception is caught
       → handling code executes
       → normal flow continues after the try-catch

5) If not handled in the same method
   - The method terminates abruptly
   - The exception is propagated to the caller method

6) Propagation up the call stack
   - JVM repeats the search for a matching `catch` block
   - This continues from caller to caller

7) If a matching catch block is found
   - The exception is caught
   - Handling logic executes
   - Stack unwinding stops

8) If no handler is found in any method
   - The exception reaches the JVM default handler
   - Stack trace is printed
   - Program terminates abnormally

// Example
class Test {
    static void m1() {
        int x = 10 / 0;   // Exception detected here
    }

    static void m2() {
        m1();             // Exception propagates to m2
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            m2();         // Exception propagates to main
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught in main");
        }
    }
}

// throw & catch in same method
class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error");
        } catch (RuntimeException e) {
            System.out.println("Handled here");
        }
    }
}
