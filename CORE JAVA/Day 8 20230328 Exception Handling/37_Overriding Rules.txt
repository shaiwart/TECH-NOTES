1) arguments must be same otherwise it becomes "overloading".
2) returntype of overriding can be co-variant.
3) overriding method must have same or more accessibility as compare to overridden method.
4) overriding and checked-exception rule :
	a) overriding method may not declare any checked exception.
	b) overriding method can declare same checked exception or its sub-type declared by overriden method.
	c) overriding method can not declare checked exception not declared by overriden method.
	
	- unchecked exceptions
	*) overriding method can declare unchecked exception.
	*) overriding method can declare unchecked exception not declared by overriden method.

// Main fundamental behind this rule is : polymorphism should be possible. and it should not be restricted. 
// And it should be possible to handle exception at runtime.
