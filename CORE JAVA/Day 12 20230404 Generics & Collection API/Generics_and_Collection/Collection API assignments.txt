1) accept 10 numbers from user and add them inside the ArrayList.
using ListIterator display all the numbers bidirectionally.

2) on the developer side:
	create a generic class which can accept any type
		with setters , getters and toString methods.
	create necessary jar files and  documentation.

on client side 
	create the object of above generic class and invoke its setters , getters and display the object.
  

3) create LinkedList with the values 10,20,30 and 40.
display it.
now insert 500 in the beginning.
	insert 400 at 2nd position.
	add 1000 at the end.
display the list again.

4) add 5 numbers inside CopyOnWriteArrayList and show how can you add one more number at the same time of traversal through its iterator.


5) create a class "MyClass".
create 5 different objects of it.
add them in a ArrayList.
store ArrayList in file.
Now open a file, read ArrayList and display all objects.

6) create a HashMap.
store  prn no. and students name of 10 students inside the HashMap.
display it using iterator.

7) create a hierarchy as follows
	interface Game- play() method
	Derive at least 3 classes from it. ( Cricket, Chess and Football )
Now Create generic class which can take Game type (i.e. any sub type of Game) as parameter.
In this class try to call the play() method of the class which is passed to it.

8) Define a class "Employee" with following members
empid, empname, desig, basic.
Define a parameterised constructor which will take all these values while creating an instance.
Also define "disp()" method which will display all these details.
create 4 employees and save them in "ArrayList".
Now save this "ArrayList" in a file.
Open file , read "ArrayList" , traverse ArrayList and call "disp()" for all the objects.

9) maintain ICC ranking of at least 5 batsmen in the "HashMap".
list should be maintain as "rank" "name"
e.g. "1" "Shubhaman Gill".
Now ask any rank bet'n 1 to 5 from user. ( user input).
if user asks for a particular rank , retrieve batsman name for that rank from the HashMap.
