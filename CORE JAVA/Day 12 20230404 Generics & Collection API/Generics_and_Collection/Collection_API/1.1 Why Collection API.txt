Why Collection API?
	Arrays are fixed in size.

Collection API provides us
	- Containers
		- They are dynamic
		- Some of them are sorted
		- Some of them allow only unique elements
		- some of them are thread-safe
		- some of them are not thread-safe , so they are efficient
		- Some of them allow u to store key and value
		- All the containers implement Serializable so that they can be easily persisted inside file system.

	- Iterator
		- allows u to traverse through containers.

	- Algorithms
		- sort,count,max,min etc.


Entire support for Collection API has been given inside "java.util" package.
