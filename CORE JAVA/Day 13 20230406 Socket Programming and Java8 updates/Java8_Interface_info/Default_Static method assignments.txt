1) define interface "First" with "default void fun()" and interface "Second" with "default void fun()". 
Now derive a class Child from both these interfaces. 
Inside main function instantiate Child class instance and invoke "fun" method.

2) define interface "Third" with "default void disp1()" and "static void disp2()" methods.
derive a class "Sub" from "Third" ( do not override "disp1")
inside main function invoke "disp1" and "disp2" methods.

3)define interface "Fourth" with "default void disp3()" method.
define a class "Base1" with "public void disp3()" method,
now derive a class Sub1 from "Base1" and "Fourth". Sub1 class should have only "public void myfun()" method.
inside main create an object of "Sub1" and invoke "disp3".
once you get the result, also try to invoke "disp3" of "Fourth"

4) define interface "Base1" with "default void fun1()".
derive an interface "Sub1" from "Base1" with "default void fun2()"
derive a class "Sub2" from "Sub1". It should have only "public void fun3()" method.

inside main function, create an object of "Sub2" and make sure when u invoke "fun3", it should call "Sub1's fun2" which should call "Base1's fun1" method.

5) define interface "First" with "static void disp1()" method.
class "Base" with "static void disp2()" method.
derive a class "Sub" from "Base" and "First"
now define a class Demo in which define "main" method.
inside main show how many ways you can invoke "disp1" and "disp2" methods.
