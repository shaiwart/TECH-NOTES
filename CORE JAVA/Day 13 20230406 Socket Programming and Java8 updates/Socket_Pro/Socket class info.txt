Socket class on client side allows you to connect to the server. So when u instantiate Socket class in client application you need to pass two arguments
	1) machine name on which server application is running

	2) port no on which you would like to get connected.

 Since Socket class allows client to get connected with the server, Socket class on client side represents the server.



Socket class on server side:

	When client gets connected with the server, server application also gets a Socket.

So Socket class on server side is used to represent client.
