what does ServerSocket class do?

	ServerSocket class allows server program to wait for client request on the given port no.

	This is possible with the help of "accept()" of ServerSocket class.

	So we can say that "accept()" of ServerSocket class is similar to "receive()" method of DatagramSocket.
