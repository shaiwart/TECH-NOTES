
		constructor

is a special member function.

It is special because

a) it is used to initialize instance members.
b) it has no return type
c) it is called as soon as object is created.


There are 2 types of constructors in java.

a) default or no-arg constructor
b) parameterized constructor

a) default or no-arg constructor
	it is a constructor with no arguments.
e.g.

	MyClass()
	{
	}

when u don't define any constructor in the class, compiler provides default or no-arg constructor.

b) parameterized constructor
	constructor with at least one argument.
e.g.
	MyClass(int k)
	{
	}
this has to be explicitly provided by the programmer.


public class MyClass11
{
	int num;
	MyClass11(int num)
	{
		this.num=num;
	}
	MyClass11()
	{
	}
	p.s.vm
	{
		MyClass11 m2=new MyClass11(200); // you need parameterized constructor
		MyClass11 m1=new MyClass11(); // you need default or no-arg constructor
	}
}

java does not have destructor.
just before object gets garbage collected, following method gets called.

protected void finalize()
{
}

Since there is no guarantee as to when exactly object will get garbage collected, u can not rely upon "finalize" method to release the resources such as Connection , Socket etc.

Garbage collection can not be forced in java. U can just make a request for Garbage Collection , by invoking a method "System.gc()". or "Runtime.getRuntime().gc()".
