constructor
	It is a special member function .
Special because

a) it is used to initialize (construct) the instance member/s.
b) it has got the same name as of class
c) it does not have a return type.

There are 2 types of constructor

1) default or no-arg constructor

	constructor having no arguments.
	if no constructor is defined in the class, compiler by default provides "no-arg constructor".

2) parameterized constructor
	constructor with at least one argument.


In which case no-arg constructor is required
	MyClass m1=new MyClass();

	new MyClass();

In which case parameterized constructor is required
	MyClass m1=new MyClass(20);

	new MyClass(40);

what happens when object is created.

a) memory is allocated for instance member/s.
b) members are implicitly initialized with default values e.g primitives like int,short etc  as 0 , boolean as false, reference types as null.  If programmer has done any explicit initialization, members are initialized.
c) constructor is called and if programmer has done any explicit initialization inside it, members are initialized accordingly.
