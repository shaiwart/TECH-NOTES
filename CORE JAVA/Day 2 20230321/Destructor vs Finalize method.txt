

main()
{
	Sample s1;  // object creation
		1) instance members are allocated memory
		2) default constructor is called




}  // s1 goes out of scope and hence "destructor" gets called.

Destructor in C++ allows you to perform clean up task if any i.e. if you want to release the resources like File,Socket etc.

java does not have destructor.
just before object gets garbage collected, following method gets called.

protected void finalize()
{
}

Since there is no guarantee as to when exactly object will get garbage collected, u can not rely upon "finalize" method to release the resources such as Connection , Socket etc.

Garbage collection can not be forced in java. U can just make a request for Garbage Collection , by invoking a method "System.gc()". or "Runtime.getRuntime().gc()".
