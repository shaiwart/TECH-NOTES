stringCollection.stream().filter((s) -> s.startsWith("a")).forEach(System.out::println);

stringCollection.stream()
		Returns a sequential Stream with this collection as its source. 

Interface Stream<T>

	filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate) 

filter() accepts “Predicate”

Predicates
Predicates are boolean-valued functions of one argument. The interface contains various default methods for composing predicates to complex logical terms (and, or, negate)

filter((s) -> s.startsWith("a"))
here we are passing child class of "Predicate" 		[(s) -> s.startsWith("a")] which implements "test(T t)" method which returns boolean.

filter() method
Returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate. 

filter() method returns
	Stream
		we are invoking "forEach()" method of stream which takes the argument as
child class of "Consumer" functional interface .
this child class of "Consumer" implements following function

 HYPERLINK "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html" \l "accept-T-" accept( HYPERLINK "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html" \o "type parameter in Consumer" T t) 

Performs this operation on the given argument.
In our case the operation is “System.out::println”


forEach(System.out::println);
	here forEach takes implementation of 

Interface Consumer<T>
		Functional Interface:
This is a functional interface and can therefore be used as the assignment target for a lambda expression or method reference.

Consumers
Consumers represents operations to be performed on a single input argument


Collections in Java 8 are extended so you can simply create streams either by calling Collection.stream() or Collection.parallelStream().

Filter accepts a predicate to filter all elements of the stream. This operation is intermediate which enables us to call another stream operation (forEach) on the result. ForEach accepts a consumer to be executed for each element in the filtered stream. ForEach is a terminal operation. It's void, so we cannot call another stream operation.
