		Reusability

means using existing type while defining a new type. It can be achieved in two ways:
a) composition/aggregation [has-a relationship]
b) inheritance [is-a relationship]

you go for composition/aggregation when you want to use some of the functionalities of existing type inside new type.
	e.g.
	while designing "Car" you would reuse "Engine" by composition/aggregation, because "Car" is not an "Engine" it just needs some functionalities of Engine.

you go for inheritance when you realize that new type is "same as" existing type.
	e.g.
	while designing "Car" you would reuse "FourWheeler" because Car is same as FourWheeler.
