What is the role played by Compiler in case of late binding?

Suppose we have,

		base ref=new sub1();  // upcasting
		ref.disp();  // late binding

when compiler encounters "ref.disp()" ,
	for the compiler "ref" is of type "base". So compiler searches "disp()" inside "base".
if it's there,accessible and non-final, compiler writes an instruction for runtime to follow. That instruction is 
" during runtime check the content of "ref" and invoke "disp()" accordingly.
