class base
{
	void disp() // overridden
	{
		System.out.println("base disp");
	}
}
class sub1 extends base   
{
	void disp() // overriding
	{
		System.out.println("sub disp");
		
	}
}
public class Demo14
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		sub1 s1=new sub1(); 
		s1.disp();
	}
}

In the above example when compiler encounters the statement "s1.disp()", what compiler does?
	ans: For the compiler "s1" is of type "sub1". Compiler will search "disp()" in "sub1"
is it there ? yes
is it accessible from main ?  yes
is it final ?  no
is it static ?  no

now compiler writes an instruction for runtime to follow. What is that instruction ?
ans: during runtime check the content of "s1" and invoke "disp()" of that content (object).

so what happens in the above example?
	during runtime content of "s1" is "sub1's object", hence "disp()" of "sub1" gets invoked.
