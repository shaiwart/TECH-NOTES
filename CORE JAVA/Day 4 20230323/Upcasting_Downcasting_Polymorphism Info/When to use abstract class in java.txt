When to use abstract class in java?


while designing Parent class, if u realize that there is some functionality compulsorily required in child classes but Parent class is not able to define it. This functionality is a contract or abstract function. Since abstract function can not be declared inside non-abstract class, u have to make class as abstract.

abstract class cannot be instantiated.
	because abstract class is incomplete i.e. it has at least one contract [abstract method]

can abstract class have a constructor?

	yes, it will be invoked from sub class constructor when sub class gets instantiated.
