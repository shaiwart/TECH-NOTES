Outer.inner i=o1.new inner();

	here when inner class gets instantiated, compiler puts a reference of "Outer" class inside inner class object. That reference refers to the object where "o1" refers to.

Why compiler does that?

	because even though they are "outer" and "inner" classes for a developer, for JVM these two are different classes altogether.

How compiler does that?

	compiler adds a parameterized constructor accepting "outer" class reference inside "inner" class and discards all the other available constructors.
