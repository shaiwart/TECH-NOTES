// Converting Primitive --> Wrapper

// Before JDK 1.5 (that is jdk 5)

	converting primitive to Wrapper


	int num=10;

	Integer ob=new Integer(num);


// JDK 1.5 onwards
	
	int num=10;
	Integer ob=num; // Autoboxing

	i.e. Autoboxing means assigning primitive to wrapper

	here when we do autoboxing i.e.
		Integer ob=num;
	what compiler does is, compiler converts above statement into the statement which we used to write before jdk5
		i.e.
		Integer ob=new Integer(num);
	why compiler does this?
		it's because JVM doesn't understand autoboxing.
	So we can say that autoboxing is only at compiler level. It is just a syntactical sugar for a developer.
