Why main function's signature is:

	public static void main(String args[])
		or
	public static void main(String ...args)


	public - JVM should be able to access it

	static - JVM should be able to invoke it without the object of a class in which main function is defined.

	void - main function is not supposed to return anything to the JVM

	String args[] - main function should be ready to accept command line arguments 
			command line arguments are those which we pass at the time of executing the program. These are the arguments which are passed to the main function.
