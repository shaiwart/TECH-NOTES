if you want to invoke 6-7 functions from main, is it advisable to make them static so that we can invoke with the syntax "classname.function" ?


non-static method
	works on the state of the object.


static method
	is used to access private static variable.
		+
	it's a utility method. That means whatever data is provided during invocation static method works on it and performs the action.
