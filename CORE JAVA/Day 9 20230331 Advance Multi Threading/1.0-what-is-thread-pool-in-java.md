# Thread Pools in Java

## Background
Server Programs such as database and web servers repeatedly execute requests from multiple clients and these are oriented around processing a large number of short tasks.

An approach for building a server application would be to create a new thread each time a request arrives and service this new request in the newly created thread.

While this approach seems simple to implement, it has significant **disadvantages**. A server that creates a new thread for every request would spend more time and consume more system resources in creating and destroying threads than processing actual requests.

Since active threads consume system resources, a JVM creating too many threads at the same time can cause the system to run out of memory. This necessitates the need to limit the number of threads being created.

## What is ThreadPool in Java?
- A thread pool contains **previously created threads** to execute a given task.
- These threads are initially **idle**. Once any task comes a randomly selected thread from thread pool will be made **active** and asked to perform the task.
- Once the task is over the thread is not destroyed but simply sent back to the pool for reuse.
- Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.
