1) create a multi-threaded application by using Thread pool.create 2 threads. each thread should display characters from A to J. [ make sure while one thread executes , other thread should not interfere ]
 
2) create a multi-threaded application by using Thread pool.create 2 threads. each thread should display numbers from 1 to 10. [ make sure while one thread executes , other thread should not interfere ]
Also when first thread displays nos. from 1 to 5 it should released the lock and allow other thread to display nos. from 1 to 5 and then previous thread will display nos. from 6 to 10 and so on.


3) create a multi-threaded application by using Thread pool and ReentrantLock (explicit locking) .create 2 threads. each thread should display characters from A to J. [ make sure while one thread executes , other thread should not interfere ]
