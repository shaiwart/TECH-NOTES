File f=new File("d:\\FileDemo.java");
	here we just create a File class object just to check wheather file exists or not, since we r reading from file ,if file doesn't exist we would like to exit.
			if(!f.exists())
			{
				System.out.println("file does not exists");
				System.exit(0);
			}

	FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream(f)
		here we open a file "FileDemo.java" in read mode.

	byte b[]=new byte[((int)f.length())];
		file contents can be read inside byte array , that's why we create byte array equivalent to the length of file.
	
	fis.read(b);
		here we read the contents of file inside byte array.
	
	String ss=new String(b);
		since byte array can not be readable we convert into String.
	
	System.out.println(ss);
		here we display the contents of file.
