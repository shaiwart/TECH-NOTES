Developer code
			class Student implements Serializable 
			{
			}

			writeObject(s);           // serialization
				a) class Student will be given a unique id called as SerialVersionUID
				b) This id will be then stored inside the file.




Client code

			readObject();            // deserialization

			1) class Student gets loaded
			2) class Student will be given a unique id called as SerialVersionUID
			3) This generated id will be checked with the id which is there inside the file.
			4) if they match then deserialization happens successfully otherwise we get "InvalidClassException"
		[ This is to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.]
