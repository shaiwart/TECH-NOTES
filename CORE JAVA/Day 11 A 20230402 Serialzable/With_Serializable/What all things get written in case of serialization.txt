What all things get written in case of serialization?

1) metadata (only information including "SerialVersionUID")
	from sub class to base class recursively till "Object" is not encountered
2) actual data (instance members) 
	from base class to sub class

3) metadata of "has a" till u don't get "reference type" as "has a" member
	actual data of "has a"
