			object persistence

it means saving the state of an object inside either filesystem or database so that it can be retrieved back in future.

When we save the state of an object inside filesystem , it is known as "Serialization".

in java there are two rules for Serialization:

	a) a class has to implement either Serializable or Externalizable interface.

	b) class must have all the instance members of type serialized. (Serialized type means which can be easily converted into sequence of bytes) . By default all the primitives are of serialized type.
Reference type can be made serialized type by implementing either Serializable or Externalizable interface.

Serializing object means writing Object inside filesystem as follows:
		FileOutputStream fos=new FileOutputStream("filename");
		ObjectOutputStream oos=new ObjectOutputStream(fos);
			oos.writeObject(<object to be written>);

Deserializing object means reading object from filesystem as follows:
		FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("filename");
		ObjectInputStream ois=new ObjectInputStream(fis);
			ois.readObject();
