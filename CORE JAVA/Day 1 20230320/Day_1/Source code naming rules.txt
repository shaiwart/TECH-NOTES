whether "public" is compulsory for class?

	no
we make public class so that client or user of the class from anywhere can access the class.

public class A
{

}

how will you save your code?

A.java

how will you compile?

javac A.java

	you will get A.class [ bytecode ]



public class A
{

}

B.java

javac B.java

	compiler will give following error message:
		class "A" is public and hence must be there inside "A.java"

	you must save above code as "A.java"

public class A
{

}
public class B
{

}

if we save above code by "A.java"

	javac A.java
		class "B" is public and hence must be there inside "B.java"

if we save above code by "B.java"
	java B.java
		class "A" is public and hence must be there inside "A.java"

class A
{
	main()
	{
	}
}
class B
{

}

if we save our code by "A.java"
	javac A.java
		it will generate
			A.class
			B.class

	how will I execute this code?
		java A
		   it will work


		but if I execute it as:
			java B
				it won't work


class A
{
	
}
class B
{
	main()
	{
	}
}

if we save our code by "A.java"
	javac A.java
		we'll get :
			A.class
			B.class

	java A
		it won't work
	java B
		it will work
class A
{
	
}
class B
{
	
}

if we save our code by "A.java"
	javac A.java
		we'll get :
			A.class
			B.class

	java A
		won't work
	java B
		won't work


class A
{
	
}
class B
{
	main()
	{
	}
}

if we save our code by "B.java"
	javac B.java
		we'll get :
			A.class
			B.class

	java B

public class A
{
	
}
class B
{
	main()
	{
	}
}

if we save our code by "A.java"
	javac A.java
		we'll get :
			A.class
			B.class

	java A
		won't work

	java B
		will work

class A
{
	
}
class B
{
	main()
	{
	}
}

if we save our code by "sample.java"
	javac sample.java
		we'll get :
			A.class
			B.class

	java B
		will work
