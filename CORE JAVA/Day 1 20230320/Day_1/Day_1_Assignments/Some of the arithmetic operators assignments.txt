1) Accept two numbers and add them.
CODE:

import static java.lang.System.out;
import java.util.*;

public class Myclass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num1, num2;
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        out.println("Enter first number: ");
        num1 = sc.nextInt();
        out.println("Enter second number: ");
        num2 = sc.nextInt();

        out.println("The summation of "+num1+" & "+num2+" is: "(num1+num2));
    }
}

OUTPUT:

2) accept two numbers and subtract them.
3) accept two numbers and multiply them.
4) accept two numbers and devide them.
5) accept two numbers and check whether first number is greater or second number is greater or they are equal.
6) accept a number and check whether it is divisible by 3 or not.
