inheritance

class MyApp extends Thread
{
	run()
	{
	}

}


	vs

class MyClass1 implements Runnable
{
	run()
	{
		logic 1
	}
}
class MyClass2 implements Runnable
{
	run()
	{
		logic 2
	}
} 

class MyApp 
{
	private Runnable ref; // prog to interface, loose coupling, any implementation of Runnable can be passed here

	MyApp(Runnable ref)
	{
		this.ref=ref;
	}
	void perform()
	{
		Thread t1=new Thread(ref);
		t1.start();
	}
}


difference between applying "synchronized" keyword and "synchronized block":

synchronized public void run()
{
	10 statements e.g

}

in above case, we have all 10 statements are blocked for a particular thread. i.e. unless a particular thread executes all 10 staements , second thread will not execute. It should be avoided if all 10 statements are not critical.



public void run()
{
	synchronized(this)
	{
		4 statements e.g
	}
	other 6 statements [ not so critical ]
}

above code will give u performance advantage as compare to previous code because only first 4 statements are blocked. once a thread completes first 4 statements , other thread can execute.
