Here the most imp. thing is that since "return" statement is given inside "try" "catch" and "finally" so,compiler removes "return" from both try and catch. So that means we have only one "return" statement inside "finally". Also this example is one of the scenarios where "finally" block does not get executed.


let's discuss this application flow considering value 5

Execution starts with main() function.

disp() method is called by passing the value 5

control goes inside "disp()" method

value 5 is passed to the variable "k"

accept() method is called from disp() by passing same value i.e. 5

control goes inside "accept()" method.

since 5 is not less than equal to zero, exception is not raised.

control goes back to disp()

since no exception was raised , "catch" block does not get executed. control goes to "finally".

inside finally block we get unhandled exception "NullPointerException" because of which finally can not be completed and execution aborts.



let's discuss this application flow considering value -5

Execution starts with main() function.

disp() method is called by passing the value -5

control goes inside "disp()" method

value -5 is passed to the variable "k"

accept() method is called from disp() by passing same value i.e. -5

control goes inside "accept()" method.

since -5 is less than equal to zero, exception is raised.

control goes back to disp()

since exception was raised , control first goes inside "catch" and then "finally".

inside finally block we get unhandled exception "NullPointerException" because of which finally can not be completed and execution aborts.
