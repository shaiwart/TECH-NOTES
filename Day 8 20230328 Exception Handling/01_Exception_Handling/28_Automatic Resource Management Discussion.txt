		Automatic Resource Management

what is Resource Management?

	it means releasing the resources once you used them.

Before java7  programmer had to do Explicit Resource Management.

	e.g

try
{
	FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("abc.txt");
		// code to read the file
}
catch(FileNotFoundException e)
{
	e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
	fis.close();
}


what is exactly Automatic Resource Management (ARM) ?

	it means now (java7 onwards) programmer can write the code as follows:

	// ARM block

	try(FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("abc.txt"))
	{
		// code to read the file
	}
	catch(FileNotFoundException e)
	{
		e.printStackTrace();
	}

That's it. it means you don't have to define "finally" block.

when you compile above code , compiler will convert this code into:

try
{
	FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("abc.txt");
		// code to read the file
}
catch(FileNotFoundException e)
{
	e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
	fis.close();
}	

That is compiler provides "finally" block which has "fis.close()" statement. So since compiler takes care of releasing resource/s , It is known as "Automatic Resource Management"

can we write any class inside ARM block?

	No. inside ARM block you can write only those classes which implement "AutoCloseable" or "Closeable" interface.
