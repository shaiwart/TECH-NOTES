// WHAT IS EXCEPTION
An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that interrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.



// WHY EXCEPTIONS

In traditional programming, error detection, reporting, and handling often lead to confusing  code because programmers would use error code inside the main logic.

Main advantages of exceptions:

1. Exceptions are readable e.g. FileNotFoundException,ClassNotFoundException,NullPointerException etc.

2. the ability to propagate error reporting up the call stack of methods. i.e. if a method does not want to handle an exception it can propagate it to the caller and so on. we did not have this advantage in traditional programming.

3. because all exceptions thrown within a program are objects, the grouping or categorizing of exceptions is a natural outcome of the class hierarchy.

4. execution continues. program does not terminate.
