		Automatic Resource Management

what is Resource Management?

	it means releasing the resources once you used them.

Before java7  programmer had to do Explicit Resource Management.

	e.g

try
{
	FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("abc.txt");
		// code to read the file
}
catch(FileNotFoundException e)
{
	e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
	fis.close();
}


what is exactly Automatic Resource Management (ARM) ?

	it means now (java7 onwards) programmer can write the code as follows:

	// ARM block

	try(FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("abc.txt"))
	{
		// code to read the file
	}
	catch(FileNotFoundException e)
	{
		e.printStackTrace();
	}

That's it. it means you don't have to define "finally" block.

when you compile above code , compiler will convert this code into:

try
{
	FileInputStream fis=new FileInputStream("abc.txt");
		// code to read the file
}
catch(FileNotFoundException e)
{
	e.printStackTrace();
}
finally
{
	fis.close();
}

That is compiler provides "finally" block which has "fis.close()" statement. So since compiler takes care of releasing resource/s , It is known as "Automatic Resource Management"


⭐️ can we write any class inside ARM block?
	No. inside ARM block you can write only those classes which implement "AutoCloseable" or "Closeable" interface.
	This is because the JVM automatically invokes the close() method at the end of the try block, and only these interfaces guarantee the presence of the close() method.

	Valid ARM example:
	try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("data.txt")) {
		// use the file
	}

	Invalid ARM example:
	try (String s = "hello") {   // compile-time error
		// String does not implement AutoCloseable
	}

	Custom class example:
	class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
		public void close() {
			System.out.println("Resource closed");
		}
	}

	try (MyResource r = new MyResource()) {
		// use resource
	}
