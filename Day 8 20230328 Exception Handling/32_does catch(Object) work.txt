
will following code work?

	try
	{
		some code
	}
	catch(Object e)
	{

	}

no above code wont compile.

why?

because if "catch(Object)" is allowed , then people can write

throw new String("hello");

throw new Integer(20);

throw new Sample();

etc.

and the rule is along with "throw" you can have class of type "Throwable" only.
