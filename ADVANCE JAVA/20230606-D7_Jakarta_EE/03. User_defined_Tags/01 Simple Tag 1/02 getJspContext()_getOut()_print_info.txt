getJspContext().getOut().print("This is a first simple tag");

here Java (TagCode1) would like to write on jsp which has called it (UseFirst.jsp)

so Java has to open outputstream on JSP.

getJspContext() method gives Java the reference of JSP which has called it.

on that reference Java invokes "getOut()" which gives Java, outputstream on JSP.

and finally, on that outputstream Java can write using "print()" method.
